# 🔐 Password Strength Evaluation & Security Analysis

This project explores how password complexity impacts security by generating and evaluating multiple passwords using online strength checkers. It also highlights best practices and common password attack methods.

## ✅ 1. Passwords Created with Varying Complexity

| Password Example        | Complexity Level |
|-------------------------|------------------|
| `123456`                | Very Weak        |
| `password`              | Very Weak        |
| `Pass123`               | Weak             |
| `P@ssw0rd!`             | Medium           |
| `M!nD#B14zZ!`           | Strong           |
| `3x!T#9k$FqZ@7#Lp`      | Very Strong      |

---

## 🔤 2. Character Variations Used

- **Uppercase letters:** A–Z  
- **Lowercase letters:** a–z  
- **Numbers:** 0–9  
- **Symbols:** `!@#$%^&*()_+~`  
- **Length Range:** 6 to 16+ characters

## 📊 4. Evaluation Results

| Password      | Strength Score | Time to Crack | Feedback                        |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| `123456`      | Very Weak      | <1 sec         | Too short, only numbers         |
| `password`    | Very Weak      | <1 sec         | Common word, easily guessable   |
| `Pass123`     | Weak           | Few minutes    | Needs symbols and more length   |
| `P@ssw0rd!`   | Medium         | Few hours      | Better, but still predictable   |
| `M!nD#B14zZ!` | Strong         | Decades        | Good use of symbols and variety |
| `3x!T#9k$FqZ@7#Lp` | Very Strong | Centuries+     | Excellent complexity and length |

## 💡 5. Best Practices for Strong Passwords

- Use **12 or more characters**
- Mix **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **symbols**
- Avoid using **dictionary words** or **common patterns**
- Prefer **passphrases** (e.g., `Blue_Tiger!Runs7Fast`)
- Don’t reuse passwords across different sites

---

## 🛠️ 6. Tips Learned

- Use a **password manager** to store and generate complex passwords
- Avoid personal info (name, DOB, etc.)
- Regularly **update passwords**
- Enable **2FA** wherever possible

---

## ⚠️ 7. Common Password Attacks

| Attack Type            | Description                                       |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Brute Force**        | Attempts all combinations until it finds the correct one |
| **Dictionary Attack**  | Tries common words and known passwords            |
| **Credential Stuffing**| Uses previously leaked credentials on new sites   |
| **Phishing**           | Tricks the user into giving up their password     |

---

## 🛡️ 8. How Password Complexity Improves Security

- Weak passwords (e.g., `123456`, `password`) are cracked in **seconds**
- Strong, complex passwords (16+ chars, mixed types) can take **centuries**
- More complexity = exponential increase in **crack time**
- Password strength is key in preventing **brute-force and dictionary attacks**

---

## 📎 Conclusion

Password strength is not just about length, but **diversity and unpredictability**. By following best practices and understanding attack methods, users can greatly enhance their account security.
